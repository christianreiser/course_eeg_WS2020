  "TaskDescription": "The P3 was elicited in an active visual oddball task adapted from Luck et al. (2009). The letters A, B, C, D, and E were presented in random order (p = .2 for each letter). One letter was designated the target for a given block of trials, and the other 4 letters were non-targets. Thus, the probability of the target category was .2, but the same physical stimulus served as a target in some blocks and a nontarget in others. Participants responded whether the letter presented on each trial was the target or a non-target for that block.",
  "Instructions": "In this task, a letter (A, B, C, D, or E) will be presented in the center of the screen. For each block of trials, you will be given a target letter. Your task is to respond whether the letter presented matches your target letter or does not match your target letter. If the letter matches your target letter, press the [TARGET_BUTTON] with your dominant hand. If the letter does not match your target letter, press the [NONTARGET_BUTTON] with your dominant hand. Please respond as quickly and accurately as possible.",
